Heaps : Basic Concepts
- Heaps are implemented using ARRAYS 
- parent of element i = Arr[i/2]
  left child: Arr[2*i]
  right child: Arr[2*i + 1] 
- Index of root = 1
- Time Complexity: O(NlogN)

1. Is heap completely sorted? 
- No, only the root element is either maximum(in max heap) or minimum(in min heap) 

2. Heap is based on what data structure? 
- Tree

3. How would you implement a heap? 
- Using priority queue
- Using arrays 

4. Implementation of heaps
- LRU Cache

5. Time complexity of heap sort? 
- Time complexity: O(logN)
