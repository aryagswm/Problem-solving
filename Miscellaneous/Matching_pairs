N different couple go to cinema with 2N different seats. They take their place randomly. You could make swap operations. Write a code for given input what is the minimum number of swap operations for sitting all couples with their partners? Additionally, be sure that no one swaps more than 2 times.

static int countSwaps(int[][] seats) {
        int n = seats.length;
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> unmatches = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (seats[i][0] == seats[i][1]) {
                continue;
            }

            unmatches.put(seats[i][0], seats[i][1]);
        }


        int count = 0;
        while (!unmatches.isEmpty()) {
            int l1, r1, l2, r2;
            l1 = unmatches.keySet().iterator().next();
            r1 = unmatches.get(l1);
            l2 = r1;
            r2 = unmatches.get(l2);

            unmatches.put(l1, r2);
            unmatches.put(l2, r1);
            ++count;

            unmatches.remove(l2);

            if (l1 == r2) {
                unmatches.remove(l1);
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
